# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Installable setup wizard and JSON/TOML client snippets that work outside the checkout.
- English and Russian agency information, integration contact and package installation guide.
- Local key/policy diagnostics via `passbolt_local_diagnostics` and `passbolt-mcp-doctor`; signs a synthetic marker and checks the configured server public key without vault requests.
- Built-in `https_probe` secret handler: one fixed HTTPS GET with bearer or basic authentication, verified TLS, no redirects/proxy environment/retries, and no response data returned to MCP.
- Real disposable-key selection/decryption/probe tests, target/scope/owner/replay checks and installed-wheel diagnostics.

## 0.2.0

- Explicit config-file startup and offline configuration doctor.
- Install/client guide, local setup wizard and clean-wheel validation.
- Isolate active GPG keyrings without copying agent sockets; stop the private runtime agent on close. Support MSYS GnuPG paths on Windows.
- Passwords remain in server custody. GnuPG must be installed separately. Real disposable-key crypto tests run in the Linux gate. Secret producer and automatic unknown-write reconciliation are future work.
- LicenseRef-ZAI-ONE and Issues-based feedback policy.
